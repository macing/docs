For sensitive information, you can quickly add a watermark before sharing.
  
After confirming the screenshot selection, click the watermark tool icon and enter the watermark text in the content field. 1Capture offers two watermark styles:
  
1. Multi-line watermark: The watermark text covers the entire image.
2. Single-line watermark: The watermark text appears in one line and can be dragged to adjust its position.
  
Use the secondary toolbar to adjust the color, opacity, angle, and size of the watermark.
