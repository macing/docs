For professionals such as developers and designers, it's often necessary to pin text, code, images, and other content to the desktop for easy comparison. 1Capture supports pinning screenshots, local images, and clipboard images to the desktop.

## How to Pin Images

**Pin Screenshots to Desktop: ** Press the screenshot shortcut, then select the capture area, and finally choose the "Pin to Desktop" icon from the toolbar. You can also press <kbd>P</kbd> to quickly pin the screenshots.

**Pin Local Images to Desktop: ** Select "Open Local Images" from the menu bar menu or drag a local image onto the 1Capture menu bar icon to open it. You can then pin the image quickly by pressing <kbd>P</kbd>, just like with screenshot annotations.

**Pin Clipboard Images to Desktop: ** Select "Open Clipboard Images" from the menu bar menu. This works like screenshot annotation, allowing you to quickly pin the image by pressing <kbd>P</kbd>. You can also choose "Pin Clipboard to Desktop" from the menu bar to pin the image directly.

## Pinned Images Operations

**Zoom and Transparency: ** Use the mouse wheel or trackpad zoom gesture to zoom in or out on an image. Hold <kbd>Command</kbd> while scrolling the mouse wheel to adjust the image opacity. These two operations can be swapped in the settings panel.

**Rotation and Flipping: ** Right-click the pinned desktop image to rotate or flip it.

**Toggle Thumbnails: ** Press <kbd>S</kbd> to toggle between the current size and thumbnail view.

**Toggle Original Size: ** Press <kbd>Z</kbd> to toggle between the current size and the original size.
