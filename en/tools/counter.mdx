When adding annotations to screenshots, you often need to use numbered points to distinguish notes. However, writing annotations directly on the image may obscure content. 1Capture offers a feature that displays annotations in the sidebar, effectively solving this issue.

Enter capture mode, switch to the Counter tool, and add counting points to annotate the image. Each time you add a counting point, a note dialog will appear. The notes you enter will be displayed in order on the right side of the screenshot after saving.
