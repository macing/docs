The Remark tool allows efficient annotation of screenshots, enabling quick issue marking while ensuring a clean appearance. It is recommended for developers, product designers, designers, and other users who frequently provide screenshot feedback.
  
After dragging to select the screenshot area, choose the Remark tool. Then click on the target area to set the starting point. Next, move the cursor to an empty space and click again to create a text box. After entering text, a neat annotation is complete.

If you need to change the style of a remark, use the secondary toolbar of the Remark tool. Here, you can adjust the starting point and text box style of the note as needed.
