1Capture is a simple and easy-to-use screenshot tool with most features being straightforward. However, some tips can help you capture screenshots more efficiently.

## Using Tool Shortcuts

1Capture offers a variety of annotation tools that you can select using the mouse or tool shortcuts. The app includes preset shortcuts for some tools, and hovering the cursor over a tool displays its shortcut. Pressing the shortcut selects the corresponding tool.

You can also modify these shortcuts in Settings > Toolbar.

## Mouse/Trackpad Scrolling

Throughout the app, many actions can be quickly adjusted using mouse/trackpad scrolling.
  
- After selecting a capture area, you can adjust the corner radius by scrolling.
- When a tool is selected, if the secondary toolbar contains sliders, you can adjust the sliders by scrolling. Scrolling directly to adjust the first slider; hold <kbd>Command</kbd> while scrolling to adjust the second slider; hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while scrolling to adjust the third slider.
- After pinning an image, you can resize it using scroll gestures.
  
For tools that support scrolling adjustments, their tooltips include the icon shown below.

## Customizing Toolbar

Everyone uses annotation tools with different preferences and frequencies, so 1Capture offers a customizable toolbar feature. This allows each user to tailor the toolbar according to their own usage habits.

Open 1Capture settings and switch to the Toolbar tab. Drag tools to reorder them. Check the toolbar checkbox to control whether the tool appears on the toolbar. For tools not shown on the toolbar, click the three-dot icon on the right to access them.

## Double-click the left mouse button

Double-clicking the left mouse button is a favorite action for many users. In 1Capture, you can double-click the left mouse button to save a screenshot (configurable in settings) or close a pinned image.
