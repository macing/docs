</CardGroup>

## Selecting a Capture Area

After entering screenshot mode, you can start selecting the capture area.  
1Capture offers three screenshot modes:
  
1. Area Capture: Right-click and drag to select the capture area.  
2. Window Capture: Click a window to capture that specific window.  
3. Full-Screen Capture: Press <kbd>F</kbd> to select the current screen for annotation; press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save and copy the current screen immediately.

Unlike system screenshots, 1Capture allows you to adjust the selection area after capturing. You can freely resize the selection for area and full-screen captures, while window captures can only be adjusted within the window boundaries. Drag the selection area to modify it.

## Annotate Screenshots

After selecting an area, an annotation toolbar appears beside it. Hovering the cursor over a tool icon displays its name and local shortcut. Selecting a tool opens a secondary toolbar for configuring that tool. Once configured, you can annotate within the screenshot area.

## Save Screenshots

After completing all annotation operations, you can save the screenshot. 1Capture offers saving, copying, AirDrop, pinning images, and other saving options. Click the corresponding icon to proceed.

## Capture Tips

Each time you enter capture mode, a prompt appears in the lower-left corner of the screen. If you're unfamiliar, refer to the prompt for guidance. Once familiar, you can disable it from the toolbar menu.
